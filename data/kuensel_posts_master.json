      "description": "? The salang tendrel for the Jamjee Solar Project is more than a ritual blessing. It is our bold leap into a new era of renewable energy. For decades, we have relied almost entirely on hydropower to light our homes and run our industries. But rivers shrink in winter, and with them, our electricity supply.

Solar, at last, offers a way to plug that gap. https:  kuenselonline.com ... a-milestone-with-shadows-to... #solar #renewable #energy #hydropoer #windmill #Bhutan",
