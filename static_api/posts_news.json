Delivering the keynote address, Health Minister Lyonpo Tandin Wangchuk stressed that “a resilient and equitable health system is not built by health professionals alone, but by a society that is informed, engaged, and empowered.” He emphasized the media’s vital role in bridging science and society, countering misinformation, and shaping healthier communities. Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh (PhD), WHO Representative to Bhutan, in her remarks today highlighted the crucial role of media in driving advocacy, awareness, and behavior change in public health.
