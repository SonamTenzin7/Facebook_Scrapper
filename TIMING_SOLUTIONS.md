# Comprehensive Timing Solutions for Kuensel Facebook Scraper

## Overview

This document describes the complete timing solutions implemented to prevent missed posts due to scraper not running when posts are published. The system includes multiple layers of protection and intelligent monitoring.

## Problem Addressed

**Issue**: Posts were being missed when the Facebook scraper wasn't running at the time of publication due to:
- Facebook's algorithm limiting post visibility over time
- Limited pagination on Facebook feeds
- Fixed hourly scraping schedule missing peak posting times
- No recovery mechanism for posts published during downtime

**Solution**: Comprehensive multi-layered timing intelligence

## System Architecture

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Actions Scheduling
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '5,35 * * * *'      # Every 30 minutes at :05 and :35
  - cron: '15,45 3-12 * * *'  # Additional runs during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM Bhutan time)
```

### 2. Adaptive Rate Limiting
- **Peak Hours (9 AM - 6 PM)**: 15-minute intervals
- **Normal Hours (6 AM - 10 PM)**: 30-minute intervals  
- **Low Activity (10 PM - 6 AM)**: 60-minute intervals
- **Weekday Boost**: 20% faster on weekdays
- **Activity-based**: Faster intervals after detecting new posts

### 3. Smart Monitoring System
- **RSS Feed Monitoring**: Checks Kuensel's RSS for new content
- **Facebook Page Change Detection**: Monitors page hash changes
- **Proactive Triggering**: Runs scraper when new content detected
- **Continuous Monitoring**: 5-minute check intervals

### 4. Historical Recovery System
- **Deep Timeline Scraping**: Up to 50 scroll attempts
- **Aggressive Content Discovery**: Enhanced navigation and parsing
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents duplicate posts during recovery
- **Scheduled Recovery**: Daily at 4 AM, weekly deep recovery on Sundays

### 5. Intelligent Notification System
- **Email Notifications**: SMTP with Gmail app password support
- **Webhook Support**: Discord/Slack integration
- **Desktop Notifications**: macOS notification center
- **Smart Alerts**: New posts, errors, recovery results, daily summaries

### 6. Comprehensive Dashboard
- **Real-time Status**: Scraper, posts, schedule, monitoring systems
- **Next Run Prediction**: Calculates upcoming runs based on schedules
- **System Health**: Database freshness, error tracking
- **Interactive Monitoring**: Live updates with continuous mode
