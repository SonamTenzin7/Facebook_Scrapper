He emphasized the media s vital role in bridging science and society, countering misinformation, and shaping healthier communities. Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh (PhD), WHO Representative to Bhutan, in her remarks today highlighted the crucial role of media in driving advocacy, awareness, and behavior change in public health.
